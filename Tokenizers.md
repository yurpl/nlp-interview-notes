### 1. Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)

- **Overview**: BPE is a data compression technique that has been adapted for use in tokenizing words. It works by iteratively replacing the most frequent pair of bytes or characters in a text with a single, unused byte.
    
- **In NLP**: In the context of NLP, BPE is used to break down words into subword units, helping models to handle out-of-vocabulary words and morphological variations.
    
- **Procedure**: It starts by tokenizing the text at the character level and then progressively merges the most frequent adjacent pairs of tokens until a desired vocabulary size is reached or until no more merges can be performed.
    

### 2. WordPiece

- **Overview**: WordPiece is similar to BPE but with a slight modification in how the merges are chosen. Instead of merging the most frequent pairs of tokens, WordPiece merges the pair that minimizes the loss in likelihood of the training data.
    
- **In NLP**: Like BPE, WordPiece helps in handling rare and out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them down into subword units.
    
- **Example**: It can break down a word like “playing” into subword units like [“play”, “ing”].
    

### 3. SentencePiece

- **Overview**: SentencePiece is a data-driven text tokenizer and detokenizer primarily used for neural network-based text generation tasks. It treats the text as a raw stream and does not assume any space between words.
    
- **Model-Agnostic**: Unlike BPE and WordPiece which often operate at the word level, SentencePiece operates at the raw text level, making it model-agnostic and applicable to multiple languages, including those without clear word boundaries.
    
- **Subword Units**: Like BPE and WordPiece, SentencePiece also generates subword units, which are helpful for handling rare words and improving generalization.
    
- **Supports BPE and Unigram**: SentencePiece implements both BPE and a unigram language model-based algorithm for subword tokenization.
    

### 4. Unigram Language Model Tokenizer

- **Overview**: This is another subword tokenization algorithm used by SentencePiece. It uses a probabilistic language model to determine the most likely segmentation of the input text into subword units.
    
- **Training**: The model is trained iteratively, starting with a large set of possible subwords and progressively pruning away the less likely candidates.
    
- **Generates Rich Subword Units**: It can generate a rich set of subword units, helping the model to better capture the nuances of the language.
    

### Summary:

- **BPE**: Merges frequent pairs of characters or subword units.
- **WordPiece**: Like BPE but chooses pairs to merge based on their impact on likelihood.
- **SentencePiece**: A text tokenizer that works at the raw text level and implements both BPE and Unigram.
- **Unigram Language Model**: A probabilistic language model used for subword tokenization.
